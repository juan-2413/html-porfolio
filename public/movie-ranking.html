<h1>The Best Movies According to Juan Cruz</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Gladiator</h3>
<p>It's my favorite movie. It features one of the most inspirational quotes I've ever heard in my life: "What we do in life echoes in eternity."</p>
<h3>Dragon Ball Z: The Legendary Super Saiyan</h3>
<p>It's one of the first Dragon Ball movies I ever watched, and the antagonist is truly memorable.</p>
<h3>Berserk (1997)</h3>
<p>Probably the most controversial on this list due to its omission of important details from the manga. However, I have to admit I loved the art style, and in my opinion, it's the best adaptation.</p>
